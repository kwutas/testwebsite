### BBQs
We have held public barbeques on the Sandy Bay campus during semester since 2023. We have historically sold both meat and vegan options as well as soft drinks. They are one of the events where the Club engages with the wider student community.
<!-- TODO: Add details about BBQs in 2023(2022?) and 2024, and our plans for 2025 -->

### UTAS Club and Society Days
The Programming Club runs a stall on UTAS Club and Society days, where people can learn about the Club. We have been participating for the past few years. 
<!-- TODO: Mention C&S days in 2022(is anything known?), 2023 and 2024, mini C&S day in 2024, and our plans for 2025 -->

### Weekly Meetups
Our weekly meetups are where Club members come together to work on ongoing projects, chill out, and discuss goings-on in a laid-back setting. Snacks included.

### General Meetings
Our general meetings are held to discuss broader club matters such as significant club decisions and the election of officers. All Club members are invited to attend and may vote in proceedings. There are two types of general meeting: our annual general meeting; and a special general meeting, which can be called at any time by the Committee.
